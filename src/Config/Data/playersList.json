    "description": "A batting powerhouse, MS Dhoni possesses the ability to destroy different bowling attacks on his own. The calmness and composure in his demeanor along with a sharp cricketing brain accounts for a lethal combination on the cricketing field and the glistening silverware in the trophy cabinets at CSK are a testimony to his extraordinary leadership skills.   He was the face of Chennai Super Kings for the first eight editions of the league, leading them to two titles (2010 & 2011) and four runner-up finishes. He then became the first player to be drafted by Rising Pune Supergiant in the ninth edition of the league. And, he once again became the first player to be retained by CSK ahead of the IPL Player Auction 2018. The 2018 season of the league had a fairytale ending with another glistening silverware added to the trophy cabinet of the Chennai Super Kings.The 2019 edition of the league too saw the CSK reach the finals of the tournament under MS Dhoni’s leadership.While MS Dhoni has hung up his boots on a 16-year illustrious career for Team India, he will be seen donning the CSK colours once again."

    "description": "The third retained player by CSK ahead of the IPL 2018 Player Auction, Ravindra Jadeja has been MS Dhoni’s go-to-man when he needed to break a partnership and the left-armer has delivered the goods on many occasions. His presence gives Dhoni the extra cushion of playing an additional batsman if needed.    Jadeja has been an enigma right since his advent in international cricket. He was part of the victorious Indian U-19 cricket team that won the World Cup in Malaysia in 2008. His performance in IPL 2008 helped Rajasthan Royals to title victory and earned him the nickname 'Rockstar' by his captain Shane Warne. In 2012 IPL player auction, Jadeja was bought by Chennai Super Kings for approx. Rs. 9.8 Crore, making him the most expensive player of the year's auction. Jadeja has represented the Gujarat Lions for two seasons and is now back with CSK for the eleventh edition of the league."

    "description": "All eyes will once again be on him as he takes charge as captain of the defending champions. Rohit Sharma has etched his name as the most successful captain in the IPL with five trophies, the most by anyone in the tournament. A prolific run-getter, the Hitman is one of the most naturally gifted batsmen in the world and has been enjoying a tremendous run with the bat. When it comes to the shorter format, there are few who can match his striking abilities. Rohit proved why he is regarded as a special talent when he became the first batsman to strike two double centuries in the ODIs and he now has three. He was one of the most consistent Deccan Chargers batsmen in the first three seasons of the IPL and was instrumental in his former franchise winning the 2009 crown.However, since 2011, Rohit has been an integral part of the Mumbai Indians guiding their batting line-up. He took over the team’s captaincy a couple of games into the 2013 season and led MI to their maiden IPL title. In the same year, MI also completed a grand double when they clinched the Champions League T20 title. His captaincy was put to test in the 2015 season after the team won just one of their first six games and were struggling to stay afloat. Mumbai Indians then staged a remarkable turnaround and lifted the Trophy for the second time with a convincing win in the final. Rohit, who made a half-century, was named the Player of the Match.  The legacy of Hitman expanded further on, after powering Mumbai Indians to title victories in the 2017 and 2019 seasons, both being last ball thrillers. Rohit led the Mumbai Indians to a successful campaign in the 2020 season, which was their second consecutive title and the Mumbai Indians skipper will be eying to become the first captain in the history of IPL to secure a hattrick of title wins."

The flamboyant Baroda all-rounder never lets pressure affect his game, but instead relishes such situations. A big hitter and a fast-bowling all-rounder, Hardik ticks all the boxes that a team desires from an all-rounder. It was no surprise that he was fast-tracked into the Indian ODI and T20 side after a successful run in the IPL 2015.In his debut IPL game against RCB, he hit a six off just the second ball he faced. However, his potential was truly known when he took Mumbai to victory with a quick-fire eight ball 21 against CSK coming when the team needed 30 from two overs.In the 12th edition of IPL, he scored 400 runs and picked up 14 wickets, proving his versatility. After missing out on a lot of action owing to a back injury, Hardik made a phenomenal comeback in the 2020 season, playing the finisher role for the team and hammering the ball in the slog overs at a strike rate of 178. Having found success both with the bat and ball at the International stage, his contribution to the Mumbai Indians line-up would prove to be extremely valuable for the side’s success in the 2021 season."
